After enabling the extension, remember to install [required dependencies](https://github.com/Rafostar/gnome-shell-extension-cast-to-tv#requirements).

## Requirements
Here is a list of required programs that Cast to TV depends on:
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (for dependencies installation)
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) (with ffprobe)

Please make sure you have all of the above installed.
They might be available in your linux distro repos.
Try installing them with your package manager or follow the links for more info.

**Before using extension** you also **must** install some additional npm packages.

* Install npm dependencies:
```
cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/cast-to-tv@rafostar.github.com
npm install
```
You can use hardware VAAPI encoding (optional). This of course requires working VAAPI drivers. More info and how to install VAAPI [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Hardware_video_acceleration).

## Info for translators
Before translating use Makefile to generate updated POT file.
```
make potfile
```
Use `cast-to-tv.pot` file in `./po` directory to generate `.po` file.
After translating, you can test your translation by running:
```
make compilemo
```
This will create `.mo` files. Restart gnome-shell for changes to be applied.
