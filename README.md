## Installation
### For latest release and changelog check out [releases page](https://github.com/Rafostar/gnome-shell-extension-cast-to-tv/releases).

[<img src="https://github.com/Rafostar/gnome-shell-extension-cast-to-tv/wiki/images/Gnome-Extensions.png" width="30%" height="30%">](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1544/cast-to-tv)

Installation from source code is described in the [wiki](https://github.com/Rafostar/gnome-shell-extension-cast-to-tv/wiki).

After enabling the extension, remember to install [required dependencies](https://github.com/Rafostar/gnome-shell-extension-cast-to-tv#requirements).

## Requirements
Here is a list of required programs that Cast to TV depends on:
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (for dependencies installation)
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) (with ffprobe)

Please make sure you have all of the above installed.

Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install npm nodejs ffmpeg
```
Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install npm nodejs ffmpeg
```

**Before using extension** you also **must** install some additional npm packages.

* Install npm dependencies:
```
cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/cast-to-tv@rafostar.github.com
npm install
```

### Optional:
* [nautilus-python](https://github.com/GNOME/nautilus-python) (for nautilus integration)

Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install nautilus-python python3-gi
```
Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install nautilus-python python3-gobject
```

Nautilus extension is included in Cast to TV (currently only in latest git source code).<br>
Alternatively you can manually install [nautilus-cast](https://github.com/rendyanthony/nautilus-cast) on which the included extension is based (please note that they are not the same).

You can optionally use hardware VAAPI encoding. This of course requires working VAAPI drivers. More info and how to install VAAPI [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Hardware_video_acceleration).

## How to use
Detailed instructions related to configuration and using the extension are in the [wiki](https://github.com/Rafostar/gnome-shell-extension-cast-to-tv/wiki).<br>
You can also find some usage examples there.

Check out [FAQ](https://github.com/Rafostar/gnome-shell-extension-cast-to-tv/wiki/FAQ), before asking questions.

## Info for translators
Preferred translation method is to use [Cast to TV Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/cast-to-tv) web page.

Alternatively you can still use Makefile and tools like Poedit to generate translations:

`make potfile` - generates updated POT file.<br>
`make mergepo` - merges changes from POT file into all PO files.<br>
`make compilemo` - compiles translation files.<br>

After compiling restart gnome-shell for changes to be applied.

## Special Thanks
